# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please do not create public issues for sensitive reports.
- Instead, open a private security advisory on GitHub once the repo is hosted, or contact the maintainer directly.
- Include steps to reproduce, impact, and any suggested mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours.
