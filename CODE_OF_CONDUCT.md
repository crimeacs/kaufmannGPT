## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Be respectful and inclusive. Accept constructive feedback. Focus on what is best for the community. Show empathy toward other community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes: harassment, trolling, publishing others’ private information, or any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
